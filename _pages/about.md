About me
======
I am a first-year PhD student in the [Department of Linguistics at Cornell University](https://linguistics.cornell.edu/). My research explores the cross-linguistic learnability and perceptibility of tone and how speakers of both tone and non-tone languages process pitch. Previously, I have investigated English-to-Vietnamese loanword phonology, specifically the process by which speakers adapt lexical stress into tone. I am a member of the [Cornell Phonetics Lab](https://conf.ling.cornell.edu/).
